Python Notes:

1. Can use print() method to display data similar to console.log()
2. Can use python interpretor on the console just by entering python on the console
3. # is used for comments

# Variable Conventions:
1. There are no constants like in JS, every variable can be reassigned
2. The variable that are meant to be constants are in capital letters, please do not reassign
3. The variables are in snake case as a convention as opposed to camel case
4. Variables with double underscore must not be changed, more priority than variables in uppercase, if changed can break something
5. The data types of variables are not required to be mentioned for eg: int, float, string etc. This is called as dynamic typing

# Null in Python:
Null is python is known as None in proper casing
